# My JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to mastering JavaScript! This space serves as my daily code journal, where I track my progress, store practice files, and gather learning materials.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repo is to document my journey in learning JavaScript. It's a centralized place for:

Daily Code Practice: Small snippets, exercises, and solutions to coding challenges.
Concept Exploration: Code files dedicated to specific topics (e.g., modules, loops, async/await, data structures).
Learning Materials: Notes, helpful articles, and links to useful resources.


This is a work in progress. Thanks for stopping by!
